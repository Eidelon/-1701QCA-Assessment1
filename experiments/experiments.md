*For a selection of 5 inventor kit experiments that you choose, fill out the following sections.

### Experiment name ###

inventor Kit project #1: Say Hello to the BBC micro:bit.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was to check the wires are connected to correct pins as per the code or the code is instructing correct pins. Check code and wire.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a basic switch, it has many applications. It has shown me that although something may seem complex it is comprised of many simple interactions..

### Experiment name ###

Inventor Kit project #2: Using a Light Sensor &analog inputs.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was Phototransistors. I was unaware they actually worked by converting light into voltage and could be used as interaction..

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as solar garden lights. The phototransistor is the component used to measure light and signals when to turn the light on.

### Experiment name ###

Inventor Kit project #3: Dimming an LED using a potentiometer.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was what a potentiometer is and oding a read value from one pin to another pin to set the value..

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as volume control for speakers, light dimmers and also adjust speeds for motors for things like fans.

### Experiment name ###

Inventor Kit project #4: Using a transistor to drive a motor.

#### Photo of completed project ####

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was using time intervals in combination with variables to control the motor speed. 1024 is the max value for output/input.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as being used to regulate a motor to ensure the motor does not overheat. This can be used in devices that need cooling.  

### Experiment name ###

Inventor Kit project #5: Using the accelerometer to control motor speed.

#### Photo of completed project ####

![Image](Task 5.jpg)


#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was that the accelerometer uses x,y, and z axis to measure gravity to create an interaction..

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as mobile devices use to set orientation. It can also be used for electronic levels and game controllers..
